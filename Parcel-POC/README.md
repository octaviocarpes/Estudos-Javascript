# Parcel POC!

 - Parcel is based around assets. An asset can represent any file, but Parcel has special support for certain types of assets like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. Parcel automatically analyzes the dependencies referenced in these files and includes them in the output bundle.

 - The most traditional file type for web bundlers is JavaScript. Parcel supports both CommonJS and ES6 module syntax for importing files.
 
 - While many bundlers require you to install and configure plugins to transform assets, Parcel has support for many common transforms and transpilers built in out of the box. You can transform JavaScript using Babel, CSS using PostCSS, and HTML using PostHTML. Parcel automatically runs these transforms when it finds a configuration file (e.g. .babelrc, .postcssrc) in a module.
